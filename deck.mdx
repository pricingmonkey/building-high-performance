# This presentation
## our journey in seven points

---

## 1. Donâ€™t get distracted by other people problems
... this presentation included ðŸ˜‰

---

majority of performance suggestion online don't apply to our project

<Image src={require("./static/prom-client-closed-pr.png")} size="contain" height="40%" />

---

we're a specialised SaaS platform for financial analytics

---

our main JS bundle is 6MB and 1.5MB compressed

---

we don't care about download/parse time of JS code

<Image src={require("./static/chrome-performance-report.png")} size="contain" height="40%" />


...even though 99% of the Internet does


---

our performance challenges are managing

thousands of financial computations inside the browser

<Image src={require("./static/grafana-calculation-rate.png")} size="contain" height="30%" width="90%" />


---

## 2. You can build a high performance
## web app with JS

---

high performance means a different thing for every project

---

for us it means

*optimised for a CPU-bounded problem with high event throughput*

  - 500-1000 Redux actions per second
  - 10^2 computations per second
	  - each at 10-50ms == between 0.1 & 5 seconds for a single "computation loop"

---

Hint: We use Web Workers

<Image src={require("./static/npm-web-workers.png")} size="contain" height="50%" width="80%" />

---

BTW CPU-bounded is a fancy talk for:

<br />

*"if you get more CPUs your program will go faster*

*WHILE increasing other resources will deliver exactly 0 value"*

---

4 years ago we were eagerly waiting for async/await to show up in Chrome

<Image src={require("./static/chrome-async-await-status.png")} size="contain" height="40%" />

---

we haven't worried about Chrome/V8 updates for over 2 years now

---

These days JS is pretty darn fast

...but JIT optimised languages usually come with caveats
<br />
<Image src={require("./static/v8-caveats.png")} size="contain" height="40%" width="80%" />

---

...and even more caveats

<Image src={require("./static/v8-caveats-2.png")} size="contain" height="40%" width="80%" />

---

Some big unsolved problems...

---

<br />
<Image src={require("./static/string-representations.png")} size="contain" height="40%" width="80%" />

 - crazy number of string representations
 - difficult to understand performance characteristics
 - no builtin hashCode, no interning

---

object polymorphism / megamorphism

---

slow Date implementation

<Image src={require("./static/v8-group-date-thread.png")} size="contain" height="40%" />

---

WebAssembly isn't likely to be an alternative yet, but getting there...

## 3. Choose boring technology... and then donâ€™t!

---

Our journey with managing asynchronous behaviour:

	-> async calls embedded in React components
	| -> thunks
	| -> Redux Saga
	| -> RxJS
	| -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs-redux

---

<CodeSurferColumns themes={[nightOwl, shadesOfPurple]}>

<Step title="async calls embedded in React components">

```js
const onKeyPressed = async (props: Props) => {
 const result = await callApi();
 props.dispatch(makeAction(result));
};

const InteractiveComponent = (props: Props) => (
   <input onKeyPress={() => onKeyPressed(props)}></input>
 );
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

---

<CodeSurferColumns themes={[nightOwl, shadesOfPurple]}>

<Step title="Thunks">

```js
// thunk.ts
const actionThunk = async (
  dispatch: Dispatch, getState: () => State
) => {
 const result = await callApi();
 dispatch(makeAction(result));
};
```

```js
// component.tsx
const onKeyPressed = (props: Props) => {
 props.dispatch(actionThunk);
};

const InteractiveComponent = ...
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>


---

<CodeSurferColumns themes={[nightOwl, shadesOfPurple]}>

<Step title="Redux Saga">

```js
// saga.ts
function* request(action: RequestAction) {
 const result = yield call(callApi);
 yield put(makeAction(result));
}

function* mySaga() {
 yield takeEvery("REQUEST_ACTION", request);
}
```

```js
// component.tsx
const onKeyPressed = (props: Props) => {
 props.dispatch({ type: "REQUEST_ACTION" });
};

const InteractiveComponent = ...
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

---

<CodeSurferColumns themes={[nightOwl, shadesOfPurple]}>

<Step title="Redux Observable">

```js
// epic.ts
action$
 .pipe(
   ofType("REQUEST_ACTION"),
   flatMap(async action => {
     const result = await callApi();
     return makeAction(result);
   })
 );
```

```js
// component.tsx
const onKeyPressed = (props: Props) => {
 props.dispatch({ type: "REQUEST_ACTION" });
};

const InteractiveComponent = ...

```

</Step>

[rxjs-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs-redux)

Exercise left to the reader ðŸ˜‰

---

Keep using boring technology

unless it gives you competitive advantage

---

Competitive advantage - solves problem at the core of your domain

---

A lot of people pay high cost of RxJS complexity

<Image src={require("./static/rxjs-complexity.png")} size="contain" height="40%" width="80%" />

Often the cost might not be worth the benefits

(based on conversations @ https://gitter.im/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)


---

## 4. Pick your battles

---

We chose React & Redux on the 1st day

---

In retrospect we could have chosen more lightweight view library

...but we didn't know any better

...and we're quite happy with our choice otherwise

---

And I think it's ok to choose a "popular" solution

if you don't know any better :D

---

We tweaked our usage of Redux with:
 - [ImmutableJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable) - Immutable persistent data collections for Javascript 
 - [reselect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reselect)
 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-log-slow-reducers
 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-ignore

---

We learnt that ironically React isn't necessarily reactive...

---

no builtin debouncing of rendering
<br />

we use https://npmjs.com/package/react-debounce-render

---

no built-in debouncing of prop-updates
<br />

... and impossible to my best knowledge
<br />

we use lazy data structures (eg. ImmutableJS.Seq) as a work around

---

 Other reactive alternatives we might try one day
   - [refract](https://refract.js.org)
   - [mobx](https://mobx.js.org)
   - [cycle](https://cycle.js.org)

---

## 5. Great performance starts with great design

---

Easy to read and well modularised code is significantly easier to optimise

<Image src="https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/3840x2160/1725135-Kent-Beck-Quote-Make-it-work-make-it-right-make-it-fast.jpg" size="contain" height="40%" width="80%" />


---

It's like cooking a three course dinner in a messy kitchen - sure possible, but...

---

Simpler code is often faster for a computer to execute

<Image src="https://github.com/thlorenz/deoptigate/raw/master/assets/xml2js.png" size="contain" height="60%" width="90%" />

---

Evolving great design is a topic of thousands of presentations,

so very quickly about our experiences...

---

We started our project in TypeScript in 2016

(when everyone laughed at us for using this exotic language)

<br />

YMMV tools require a bit of getting used to - try playing violin ðŸ˜†

---

## 6. Immutability is awesome, but comes at a cost.

---

ImmutableJS has been a blessing

---

...even though it's been pretty much abandoned for the last 2 years

<Image src={require("./static/immutablejs-unmaintained.png")} size="contain" height="40%" />

---

Records suck

---

if starting a new project consider other options:
 - https://github.com/immerjs/immer
 - https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab

---

## 7. "Mistakes were made"

---

for a while we used IndexedDB as a cache

it eventually grew to millions of entries

and schema upgrade put user's CPU into a death spiral

---

we've been using combineReducers wrong for nearly 2 years

suffering a 20%-30% performance penalty 

---

another time we upgraded to HTTP 2.0 only to realise

that many companies downgrade requests in their network stack

---

solving complex and challenging problems is a journey

---

taking chances is inevitable if you want to learn
